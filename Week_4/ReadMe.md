# üõ†Ô∏è Background Statement
> There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

> Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world‚Ä¶so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

> Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

> Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

> The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

>  This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!


# üìÇ Dataset
For this case study there is only a single table: weekly_sales

<details><summary>View Datasets</summary>
  <p>

- Regions
    
  Just like popular cryptocurrency platforms - Data Bank is also run off a network of nodes where both money and data is stored across the globe. In a traditional banking sense - you can think of these nodes as bank branches or stores that exist around the world.
  This regions table contains the region_id and their respective region_name values  
  
  <details><summary>View table</summary>
    <p>
  
    |region_id|	region_name|
    |---------|------------|
    |1	      |Africa      |
    |2	      |America     |
    |3        |Asia        |
    |4        |Europe      |
    |5        |Oceania     |
      
    </p>
  </details>

- Customer Nodes
    
  Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region - this also specifies exactly which node contains both their cash and data.

  This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!

  Below is a sample of the top 10 rows of the data_bank.customer_nodes

# ‚úíÔ∏è Case Study Questions
The following case study questions include some general data exploration analysis for the nodes and transactions before diving right into the core business questions and finishes with a challenging final request!

## A. Customer Nodes Exploration
   
   1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
   2. What is the number of nodes per region?
   3. How many customers are allocated to each region?
   4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
   5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

## B. Customer Transactions

   1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
   2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
   3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
   4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
   5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?
   
## C. Data Allocation Challenge
   
   To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

   - Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous mont
   - Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
   - Option 3: data is updated real-time
   
   For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:
   - running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
   - customer balance at the end of each month
   - minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer
   
   Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

## D. Extra Challenge
  > Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.
  
  > If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?
  
  > Special notes:
  
  > - Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!
  
## Bonus Questions

  > Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?
    - region
    - platform
    - age_band
    - demographic
    - customer_type
